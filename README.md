## 01 React Professional Portfolio
This is a professional portfolio for myself that uses React and Github pages in it's deployment.

## 02 
This portfolio has functioning links that take you to the "Home", "Projects", and "Contact" sections of the page. The "Home" section is simply an aesthetic section of the page. The "Projects" section highlights previous pieces of work I have put together with functioning links, titles, and the primary method of creation of the projects. The contact section provides links to my email and github link, as well as my home city.

## 03 Packages
This project uses react, bootstrap, and github pages to aid in it's deployment.
